      <h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>Whenever I click on a link, it sends me to index.ht# and says page not found.</h3>
        If this happens, empty your cache and restart your browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>When I start the pretest, it says Loading... and never plays.</h3>
        I am not sure what causes this. It seems to be specific to certain computers. If you have this problem, please contact me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>There is a pause at the beginning before it plays</h3>
        The audio is downloading and will start playing as soon as it is downloaded. The length of time this takes depends on how fast your internet connection is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>I am running Safari or Chrome and the progress bar stops before it is done and the piece plays until it is done instead of cutting off at 30 seconds.</h3>
        I thought I fixed that. If this keeps happening, please contact me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>I am running Internet Explorer and it doesn't work!</h3>
        No version of Internet Explorer prior to 9 (which is in beta at the time of this writing) supports the audio tag which is required to make this work. When released, this webapp will support IE9.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>That still doesn't explain why you don't support Internet Explorer</h3>
        After winning the "browser wars" in the mid to late 90s, Microsoft stopped development of Internet Explorer. During this period, standard development groups had designed new ways of using the internet and offering content, only to be ignored by Microsoft. Since then, superior browsers such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera have been developed which support these new standards. Finally after years of silence, Microsoft is about to release Internet Explorer 9 which has implemented these new features. The only way to make this work in Internet Explorer 8 and below is to use Adobe Flash which I don't have the money, time, or inclination to do.

        <h3>I am running Firefox or Safari and it says that my browser doesn't support the Audio tag.</h3>
        You are running an old version of Firefox or Safari. Support for the Audio tag was added in Firefox 3.5 and Safari 3.1. If you upgrade (which you should anyway for security and features), this webapp will start working.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>It says that I don't have Javascript enabled</h3>
        First, check to see whether you have Javascript enabled (duh). Sometimes web content filters will block javascript, so check for that. If that is not it, it is possible that there is a bug in the code which is causing the javascript to fail and show this error. Please contact me in this case.
